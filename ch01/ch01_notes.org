** Summary 
The /quick-find algorithm/ uses an array for each element. Elements
$p$ and $q$ are connected if the $pth$ and $qth$ entries in the array
have the same value. For the find operation we just compare the values
at the two indices. For the union operation we have to scan the whole
array, for each pair. It's complexity is at lest $M N$ instructions
with $N$ objects and $M$ union operations.

The /quick-union algorithm/ uses an array for each element. Where the
value at the $pth$ position indicates the "parent" of the $pth$
element. Now the find operation will involve querying the parents of
$p$ and $q$ recursively untill we find one that is its own parent,
i.e.  we get to the "topmost" parent, then compare them.
